Problem Statement :

                    A single number is a number that appeared only once in the MyNumbers table.
                    Find the largest single number. If there is no single number, report null.
                    The result format is in the following example.
                    
                     
                    
                    Example 1:
                    
                    Input: 
                    MyNumbers table:
                    +-----+
                    | num |
                    +-----+
                    | 8   |
                    | 8   |
                    | 3   |
                    | 3   |
                    | 1   |
                    | 4   |
                    | 5   |
                    | 6   |
                    +-----+
                    Output: 
                    +-----+
                    | num |
                    +-----+
                    | 6   |
                    +-----+

Solution :

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT MAX(num) AS num
FROM(
    SELECT num
    FROM MyNumbers
    GROUP BY num
    HAVING COUNT(num)=1
) AS n
